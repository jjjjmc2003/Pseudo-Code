// Fibonachi Pseudocode

// 1. Start
// 2. Set Class Fibonachi
// 3. Input as N (number of terms in the series), get from user
// 4. Fib Series, create empty array to store the Fib series
// 5. Fib series first number, set to 0
// 6. Fib series second number, set to 1

// 7. For loop to calculate the fib series
// For loop would look something like this,
// for (number = 2, number < N (user input), number increases every iteration)

// 8. Now that we have a loop, we have to add our calculation

// which would look like this:
// series of number = sum of previous two numbers
// add to array Fib Series

// 9. Add if statement so we don't break it
// if Fibseries length = N, break the loop

// 10. Print Fib Series
